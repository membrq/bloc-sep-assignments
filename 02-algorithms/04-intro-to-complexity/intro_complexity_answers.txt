1. An example of an O(1) algorithm is a hare. An O(2n) is a tortoise.

2. The best case scenario for binary search occurs when the item you're
   searching for is at the midpoint of the collection.

3. The worst-case scenario for binary search occurs when the item you're
   searching for is in the last position the algorithm will check.

4. The bounded-case scenario for binary search occurs when the item you're
   searching for is found midway between the first and last items checked.

6. The limit of the function (see graph) as n approaches infinity is infinity.

7. The Big-O of the graph is O(n).

8.  def linear(array)
      array.each do |item|
        puts item
      end
    end

10. The Big-O of binary search is O(n).

11. The Big-Ω of binary search is O(1).

12. The Big-Ө (bounded case) of binary search is O(logn).
